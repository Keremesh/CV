## Soft Skills

#### Customer-driven

In my previous role as a paralegal, I had the privilege of working closely with diverse customers, often in situations with high stakes and life-changing implications. To me, being customer-driven means always putting myself in the client's shoes and asking, "How would I want my case to be handled?" This mindset led me to go the extra mile—whether it was making a reassuring call or sending an email to provide updates on their case's progress. I believe in acting in the best interests of the customers, ensuring they feel heard, supported, and informed throughout their journey. This experience solidified my commitment to being customer-driven and delivering exceptional service.

#### Creative problem-solving

My journey into creative problem-solving is deeply personal. When my grandmother faced speech difficulties in her old age, I explored various options, but they didn't quite meet her needs. I sought a solution that would empower her to communicate effectively. This led to the creation of "Virtual keyboard", an app featuring a large keyboard and clear output, allowing her to communicate with ease.  This experience taught me the power of creativity in solving real-world challenges. I believe that creativity is not just about ideas but about finding practical solutions that make a meaningful difference.


<!-- Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevant to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevant to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had.

Here's an example

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
